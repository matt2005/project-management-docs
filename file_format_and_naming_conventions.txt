FILE FORMAT AND NAMING CONVENTIONS
==================================


Where possible and sensible, default to creating documents (like this one) in
plain text.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

Stick to standard file suffixes for standard file formats, e.g. txt (plain
text), doc (Microsoft Word), odt (OpenDocument format text), pdf (Adobe PDF).

Use all lower case file names with underscores delimiting words i.e.
"project_plan.doc", not "ProjectPlan.doc" or "Project-Plan.doc" or any other
combination!


PLAIN TEXT
----------

Use standard UTF-8 encoded text files with a ".txt" file suffix (with the
exception of the top level README file).
