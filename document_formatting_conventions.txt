DOCUMENT FORMATTING CONVENTIONS
===============================

Case
----

For plain text documents, upper case text can be used to distinguish titles
from body text, but in all other structured formats, use mixed case and prefer
lower case over title case. e.g. use "This is a heading" not "This Is A
Heading" and not "This is a Heading".

Styles and formatting
---------------------

Do not add any unnecessary formatting to document formats which allow for
endless formatting variations (Microsoft Word, Open Office, etc.). However, do
make use of paragraph styled to denote document structure, see below.


Paragraph styles and document structure
---------------------------------------

Use standard paragraph styles to denote document structure.

For Open Office this means:

    Title - The main document title
    Heading 1 - A first level heading
    Heading 2 - A second level heading, etc.
    Text body - Body text
