The aim of this project is to build up a collection of useful templates for
managing projects.

Projects differ in their documentation and reporting requirements so there is
no expectation of producing a one size fits all set of documentation. This
project is likely to develop into a set of different types of report that suit
different shapes and sizes of project and different methodologies.

This documentation project, however, is being managed in a lean/agile way, so
the structure will evolve over time, I'm not going to generate some massive
pre-determined directory structure to be set in stone for ever more.

Finally, for now, simplicity is key here. I would like to think that this set
of documents can be stored in formats that focus principally on content and
structure and are not distracted by style and presentation. However, this is a
compromise because, to be useful, it is helpful if document templates can be
lifted and applied directly without the need for further formatting. One
possible solution to this would be to have some combination of structure
documents and style sheets to automatically render the structured documents in
various different styles. But watch out, that sounds too heavy weight an idea
already!

Okay, really final point.  All contributions encouraged!
